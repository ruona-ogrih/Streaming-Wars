Key Insights
- Prime Video Dominates in Genre Breadth.
    With over 1,000 titles, Prime Video had the widest genre variety, appearing across nearly every top genre combo.
- HBO Max Delivers the Highest ROI
    despite a smaller title count. HBO Max led in average return on investment, proving that quality beats quantity.
- Predicted Gross Tracks Strongly with Budget & Ratings.
    Movies with budgets above $100M and ratings over 8.0 consistently projected grosses exceeding $500M in the model.
- Director Impact is Huge.
Names like James Cameron and the Russo Brothers averaged over $1.5B in box office gross per film, highlighting the power of star directors.
- Post 2010 Streaming Surge,
release volume climbed sharply after, ultimately peaking before COVID-19 which caused a noticeable dip between 2020–2021.
- Genre-Platform Relationships Are Clear
	•	Netflix favors action/thriller blends
	•	Disney+ focuses on animation-heavy content
	•	HBO Max leans into drama and prestige genres

## 💻 Code Preview
```python
# Convert release date & calculate ROI
df['releaseDate'] = pd.to_datetime(df['releaseDate'], errors='coerce')
df['Release Year'] = df['releaseDate'].dt.year
df['ROI'] = (df['gross'] - df['budget']) / df['budget']

# Assign suggested streaming platform
def assign_platform(row):
    if row['averageRating'] >= 7.5 and row['runtimeMinutes'] >= 100:
        return 'HBO Max'
    elif 'Animation' in str(row['genres']) or row['runtimeMinutes'] < 90:
        return 'Disney+'
    elif row['averageRating'] >= 6.5:
        return 'Prime Video'
    else:
        return 'Netflix'

df['suggestedPlatform'] = df.apply(assign_platform, axis=1)
